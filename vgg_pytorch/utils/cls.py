    model: Modified neural network model.
    model_path: Loaded model address.
    datasets: The folder used for the final classification
    dataroot: Data folders to categorize.
    img_size: Put the size of the image.
    channels: image channel. rgb->3, gray->1.
    classes_names: Categories of objects.
    device: Run-time device selection.

  Examples:
    >> model = Model(**kwargs)

    >> dataset = "mnist"
    >> dataroot = "unknown"
