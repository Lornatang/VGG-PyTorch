## How Test and Train

Both training and testing only need to modify the `config.py` file. 

### Test

- line 29: `model_num_classes` change to `1000`.
- line 31: `mode` change to `test`.
- line 79: `model_path` change to `./results/pretrained_models/VGG11-ImageNet_1K-9df8cd0f.pth.tar`.

```bash
python3 test.py
```

### Train model

- line 29: `model_num_classes` change to `1000`.
- line 31: `mode` change to `train`.
- line 33: `exp_name` change to `VGG11-ImageNet_1K`.
- line 45: `pretrained_model_path` change to `./results/pretrained_models/VGG11-ImageNet_1K-9df8cd0f.pth.tar`.

```bash
python3 train.py
```

### Resume train model

- line 29: `model_num_classes` change to `1000`.
- line 31: `mode` change to `train`.
- line 33: `exp_name` change to `VGG11-ImageNet_1K`.
- line 48: `resume` change to `./samples/VGG11-ImageNet_1K/epoch_xxx.pth.tar`.

```bash
python3 train.py
```

## Result

In the following table, the top-x error value in `()` indicates the result of the project, and `-` indicates no test.

|  Model  |   Dataset   | Top-1 error (val) | Top-5 error (val) |
|:-------:|:-----------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|
| AlexNet | ImageNet_1K | 36.7%(**43.8%**)  | 15.4%(**21.3%**)  |

```bash
# Download `AlexNet-ImageNet_1K-9df8cd0f.pth.tar` weights to `./results/pretrained_models`
# More detail see `README.md<Download weights>`
python3 ./inference.py 
```

##### Abstract

We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million
high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 different classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5%
and 17.0% which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The
neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists
of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers,
and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected
layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called “dropout”
that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the
ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%,
compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.
